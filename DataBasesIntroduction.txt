-- Problem 3. Alter Minions Table
--Change the structure of the Minions table to have new column TownId 
--that would be of the same type as the Id column of Towns table. 
--Add new constraint that makes TownId foreign key and references to Id column of Towns table.

ALTER TABLE Minions
ADD TownId INT 

ALTER TABLE Minions
ADD FOREIGN KEY (TownId) REFERENCES Towns(Id)
